Esprit are autonomous AI agents that act like real hackers—they run your code dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them with proof-of-concepts. Built for developers and security teams who need fast, accurate security testing without the overhead of manual pentesting or the false positives of static analysis tools.

## Use Cases

- **Application Security Testing** — Detect and validate critical vulnerabilities in your applications
- **Rapid Penetration Testing** — Get penetration tests done in hours, not weeks
- **Bug Bounty Automation** — Automate research and generate PoCs for faster reporting
- **CI/CD Integration** — Block vulnerabilities before they reach production

## Key Capabilities

- **Full hacker toolkit** — Browser automation, HTTP proxy, terminal, Python runtime
- **Real validation** — PoCs, not false positives
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Specialized agents collaborate on complex targets
- **Developer-first CLI** — Interactive TUI or headless mode for automation

## Security Tools

Esprit agents come equipped with a comprehensive toolkit:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| HTTP Proxy | Full request/response manipulation and analysis |
| Browser Automation | Multi-tab browser for XSS, CSRF, auth flow testing |
| Terminal | Interactive shells for command execution |
| Python Runtime | Custom exploit development and validation |
| Reconnaissance | Automated OSINT and attack surface mapping |
| Code Analysis | Static and dynamic analysis capabilities |

## Vulnerability Coverage

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Access Control | IDOR, privilege escalation, auth bypass |
| Injection | SQL, NoSQL, command injection |
| Server-Side | SSRF, XXE, deserialization |
| Client-Side | XSS, prototype pollution, DOM vulnerabilities |
| Business Logic | Race conditions, workflow manipulation |
| Authentication | JWT vulnerabilities, session management |
| Infrastructure | Misconfigurations, exposed services |

## Multi-Agent Architecture

Esprit uses a graph of specialized agents for comprehensive security testing:

- **Distributed Workflows** — Specialized agents for different attacks and assets
- **Scalable Testing** — Parallel execution for fast comprehensive coverage
- **Dynamic Coordination** — Agents collaborate and share discoveries

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/improdead/Esprit/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Configure
export ESPRIT_LLM="openai/gpt-5"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Scan
esprit --target ./your-app
```
